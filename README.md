### About Me
I am a data-driven product and analytics enthusiast with 4+ years of experience spanning consumer goods, energy, and tech. My background combines business strategy with hands-on data science and product execution — from launching products across the APMEA region at BAT to building machine learning models and dashboards at UC Davis.

My sweet spot? Driving impact by turning raw data into smart decisions — across supply chain, product, or user-facing experiences.
